    "## ✅ TASK COMPLETED: SerpAPI Time Format Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Identified:**\n",
    "- SerpAPI Google Flights API was returning 400 Bad Request errors\n",
    "- Root cause: Time ranges were being sent in wrong format (`\"06:00-12:00\"` instead of `\"6,12\"`)\n",
    "- The API expects comma-separated hour values, not time ranges with colons and hyphens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Implemented:**\n",
    "- ✅ Updated `FlightSearchPlugin` time mapping from `\"06:00-12:00\"` to `\"6,12\"`\n",
    "- ✅ Applied correct format for all time preferences:\n",
    "  - Morning: `\"6,12\"` (6 AM to 12 PM)\n",
    "  - Afternoon: `\"12,18\"` (12 PM to 6 PM) \n",
    "  - Evening: `\"18,23\"` (6 PM to 11 PM)\n",
    "- ✅ Updated agent instructions to reflect the correction\n",
    "- ✅ Verified the fix with end-to-end testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification Results:**\n",
    "- ✅ No more 400 Bad Request errors related to time format\n",
    "- ✅ SerpAPI now accepts and processes flight search requests correctly\n",
    "- ✅ All plugins and agents recreated with the updated logic\n",
    "- ✅ System is fully operational and ready for production use\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before (Incorrect):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_range_mapping = {\n",
    "    \"morning\": \"06:00-12:00\",\n",
    "    \"afternoon\": \"12:00-18:00\", \n",
    "    \"evening\": \"18:00-23:59\"\n",

    "    \"evening\": \"18,23\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-agent travel planning system is now fully operational with:\n",
    "- ✅ Robust parameter handling (no more Optional type errors)\n",
    "- ✅ Correct SerpAPI integration (proper time format)\n",
    "- ✅ Interactive conversation management\n",
    "- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation\n",

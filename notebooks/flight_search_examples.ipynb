    "The Flight Search Tool allows you to:\n",
    "- Search for round-trip and one-way flights\n",
    "- Specify passenger counts (adults, children, infants)\n",
    "- Filter by travel class, price, time preferences\n",
    "- Control layover durations\n",
    "- Include/exclude specific airlines\n",
    "- Enable deep search for more accurate results\n",

    "## Important Note: Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this notebook is in the `notebooks/` subdirectory and the `flight_search.py` file is in the parent directory (`travel-agent/`), we need to handle the import path correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to solve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Path manipulation** (used above): Add the parent directory to Python's path\n",
    "2. **Copy the module**: Create a copy of `flight_search.py` in the notebooks directory  \n",
    "3. **Relative imports**: Use relative import syntax\n",

    "## 9. Enhanced Round-Trip Flight Display\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Improvement: Clear Outbound vs Return Flight Separation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major improvements in this notebook is the enhanced formatting for round-trip flights. Here's what's new:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✨ **Before**: All segments listed chronologically\n",
    "```\n",
    "Flight Details:\n",
    "  Segment 1: United 1234 (DEP → HUB)\n",
    "  Segment 2: United 5678 (HUB → DEST)  \n",
    "  Segment 3: Delta 9012 (DEST → HUB2)\n",
    "  Segment 4: Delta 3456 (HUB2 → DEP)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌟 **After**: Clear separation of outbound and return journeys\n",
    "```\n",
    "🛫 OUTBOUND FLIGHTS:\n",
    "  🛫 Segment 1: United 1234 (DEP → HUB)\n",
    "  🛫 Segment 2: United 5678 (HUB → DEST)\n",
    "\n",
    "🛬 RETURN FLIGHTS:\n",
    "  🛬 Segment 1: Delta 9012 (DEST → HUB2)  \n",
    "  🛬 Segment 2: Delta 3456 (HUB2 → DEP)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhanced formatting uses intelligent algorithms to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detect round-trip flights** based on the `type` field from the API\n",
    "2. **Analyze flight segments** to find the logical break point between outbound and return\n",
    "3. **Separate segments** into outbound (🛫) and return (🛬) categories\n",
    "4. **Display clearly** with visual indicators and better organization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Smart Segment Separation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm considers:\n",
    "- **Airport analysis**: Detecting when flights start heading back to origin\n",
    "- **Geographic logic**: Understanding flight routing patterns  \n",
    "- **Chronological flow**: Finding natural breaks in the journey\n",
    "- **API structure**: Leveraging Google Flights' segment organization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Easier to understand** complex multi-segment round-trip flights  \n",
    "✅ **Better planning** - see outbound and return journeys separately  \n",
    "✅ **Visual clarity** with emojis and clear section headers  \n",
    "✅ **Enhanced details** including amenities, legroom, and warnings  \n",
    "✅ **Smart layover display** with overnight indicators  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key methods added:\n",
    "- `_separate_round_trip_segments()`: Intelligently splits segments\n",
    "- `_format_flight_segment()`: Enhanced segment formatting with details\n",
    "- Updated `_format_single_flight()`: Route detection and better organization\n",
    "- Enhanced `format_flight_results()`: Improved headers and summary info\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the flight search results much more readable and user-friendly, especially for complex international round-trip flights with multiple connections!"

    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use the Google Flights Search Tool with SerpApi to:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Load environment variables securely** using `load_dotenv()`  \n",
    "✅ **Handle directory structure** properly (notebook in subdirectory)  \n",
    "✅ **Search for flights** with various parameters and filters  \n",
    "✅ **Format and display results** with enhanced round-trip visualization  \n",
    "✅ **Clearly separate outbound and return flights** for better readability  \n",
    "✅ **Handle different scenarios** (round-trip, one-way, family travel)  \n",
    "✅ **Use utility functions** for saving and comparing results  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Directory Structure Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We solved the import path issue by:\n",
    "- Including the complete FlightSearcher implementation directly in this notebook\n",
    "- Adding proper path handling for notebooks in subdirectories\n",
    "- Creating a self-contained, fully functional flight search environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✈️ **Experiment** with different airports and date combinations\n",
    "- 🎯 **Try various filter combinations** to find the best deals\n",
    "- 💾 **Use the utility functions** to save and analyze your search results\n",
    "- 🔄 **Run searches periodically** for price monitoring\n",
    "- 📊 **Customize the output formatting** for your specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Development Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a standalone Python script:\n",
    "1. Copy the FlightSearcher class from this notebook\n",
    "2. Save it as a separate `.py` file\n",
    "3. Import it in your scripts with proper path handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **API key is loaded from .env** - secure and convenient\n",
    "- ⚡ **Everything works within this notebook** - no import issues\n",
    "- 🔒 **Be mindful of API rate limits** when running multiple searches\n",
